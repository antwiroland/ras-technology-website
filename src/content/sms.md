# School Management System (SMS)

## Project Overview
The **School Management System** is a comprehensive platform that enforces strict academic rules such as class progression chains, end-of-term promotions, graduation handling, and role-based permissions.

## Problem Statement
- Disorganized class structures and promotions
- Manual, error-prone academic records
- Poor visibility into student history
- Weak access control over academic data

## Solution
The system introduces a **rule-driven academic platform** that:
- Enforces a mandatory class progression chain
- Automates promotion, repetition, and graduation
- Centralizes all student records into a single profile
- Restricts actions by role (Principal, Head Teacher, Teacher, Student)
- Provides audit logs for accountability

## Roles Supported
- Student, Teacher, Head Teacher, Principal, Admin

## Core Academic Rules
- Class progression chain with no branching
- Promotions only at end of term
- Graduations for last class in the chain

## Key Modules
- Class & academic structure management
- Teaching & subject assignment
- Attendance & homework
- Fees & financial tracking
- Notifications & communication
- Audit & accountability
